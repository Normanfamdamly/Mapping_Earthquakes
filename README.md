# Mapping Earthquakes - Module 13 Challenge

Basil and Sadhana have liked all the earthquake maps I have created and asked that I at least create three more maps that focus on the tectonic plates and the major earthquakes (magnitude 4.5 and greater).  These maps will have a street, satellite and dark view of the data layout.

## Summary 
The data is displayed below with all earthquakes in bubble format. The larger the magnitude of the earthquake the larger the bubble, you will see the tectonic plates are shown via a red line that dances along the satellite photo below.  This gives you a clear picture of all these issues we are presenting.

Next, we have dark view of the tectonic plates and the major earthquakes, which is quite a pretty view.  This was done by adding a third "dark" layer to the existing layers of street and satellite.

For final comparison I have added the basic street view of the tectonic plates and last 7 days of earthquakes map below.

### Overview

All of this work was done view creation of a common set of files:

           - style.css
           - config file
           - logic file
           - index.html
     
JavaScript, D3, Leaflet and Mapbox coding and stylesheets were used to create this challenge work.
